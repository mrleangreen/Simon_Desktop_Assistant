# Simon_Desktop_Assistant (Autonomous Windows Task Executor)

This is a Python-based autonomous AI assistant designed to **interpret human language and control your Windows PC** using the mouse, keyboard, and AI-generated instructions. It can open and control applications, type, click, read screen text (OCR), and even generate full programming projects.

##  Features

- **Natural language command execution**  
- **Multi-step task planning and execution**  
- **Mouse/keyboard automation (via pyautogui)**  
- **Window detection and control (via pywinauto)**  
- **Screen reading with OCR (Tesseract + OpenCV)**  
- **File-aware context memory**  
- **Code generation (Mixtral/Mistral model)**  
- **Personal memory + task history recall**
